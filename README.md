# hello-world
This is my first repository and I am pretty excited about it. Repository is a place where you can store all the resources and ideas for your project.
I leaned how to make a different branch and made changes to it which are called commits and then merge into the master branch.It is important to describe what changes you made so that other developers working on your project can understand it.
